Simple Linear Regression:
* Problems where two variables have an implied association between each other and we are trying to find that association.
* There exists only one independent variable
* y= b0 + xb1 (equation of a straight line "The trend line"), y - the dependent variable, x - the independent variable
* Here y is directly proportional to x, with b1 as the coefficient of proportion, that defines how a unit change in x affects y.
* b0 is the constant term, it is the y-intercept which gives the value of the dependent variable y if the independent variable x is zero
* b1 is the gradient that defines increase in y with increase in x.
* In order to find the best-fitting line, the line with min error is chosen.
* For each line the error- sum(yi - yi^) is computed, where yi is the actual value and yi^ is the predicted value from the ML model.
#
* The problem in hand reads a dataset that has 2 columns, Years of Experience and Salary
* We use a simple linear regression model to find the correlation between both. 
* Most Simple linear regression model take care of feature scaling.
#Steps
* Do the preprocessing
* Create the regressor, fit the train dataset. The regressor learns from the train data
* Predict independent data values on the test data with the regressor
* Compare the predicted values with the original test data

### Normalization typically means rescales the values into a range of [0,1]. 	Standardization typically means rescales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard 	deviation of 1 (unit variance).
